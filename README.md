Creating an application where we can observe the health status of a pet.
Here we are selecting a pet from the given list of options.
Then we are allowed to name it.
Now you are allowed to choose any option from the main menu which includes options like feed, play, rest, status and exit.
From the status option, you can know the values of hunger, health and happiness.
Feed option decreases hunger and slightly increases health.
Play option increases happiness and slightly increases hunger.
Rest option improves health and decreases happiness slightly.
Also the min value of each action is set as 1 and max value is set as 10.
Staus option gives you the current status.
Esxit option exits you from the application.
